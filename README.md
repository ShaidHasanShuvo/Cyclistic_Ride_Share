# Bike Share Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for a portfolio project focused on analyzing bike share data. The project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using MS SQL Server, followed by further analysis in R and visualization using Tableau.

## Project Overview

Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago aiming to maximize annual memberships. The project focuses on understanding user behavior to design marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members. The project tasks include data cleaning, exploratory analysis, KPI creation, data analysis in R, and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) into Tableau for visualization.
